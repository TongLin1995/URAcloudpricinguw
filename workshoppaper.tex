\section{Abstract}

With the introduction of cloud computing, more and more companies choose to use remote cloud computing---saving up-front hardware payment and pay for what they use. Many cloud provider including Amazon(Amazon EC2) developed different service charging standard in order to meet the demand for different user. These days, the most prevalent pricing methods are: on-demand pricing, reserved pricing and spot-pricing. With these three different pricing, cloud user can choose among them according to their needs. Obviously, the pros of these three method respectively are: pay for what you get, reserve instances to get a significant discount, pay less than what you get but have to bear the risk that the jobs are interrupted. 

When bidding the cloud, every bidder will come across with this problem: what is the optimal bidding strategy for me? Many scholars and researchers have published papers in this topic, trying to find the optimal bidding strategy. However, since each user has different needs when using cloud, there will never be an optimal strategy that can be applied to every user. In particularly, this article take each bidder's "true value"(i.e. the revenue he will have if he pay nothing for the service) into account. We will treat spot market as an sealed-bid N+1 auction market with several assumptions including Spot-pricing market is a supply-demand market, even though there are some evidences that providers like Amazon are manually hiding instances to reduce demand. The contribution of this article will give an full set of algorithms of how to bid, when to bid and which price to choose.
